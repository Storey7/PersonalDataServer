# Personal Data App

## Overview

This project is a learning excercise to develop a RESTful implementation of a data server. The data I would like to track is social occasions, books read, films watched, music listened to, fitness and health information and rubiks cube times. The ultimate goal is to deploy this project online and be able to enter data from a simple webpage / app, allowing me to track various aspects of my life and visualise it in interesting ways.
