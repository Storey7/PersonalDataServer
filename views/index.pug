  h3 To Do </h3>
    ul
      li Add RSS feed from Letterboxd.com for films, as I already track my movies there.
      li Add "Events" tracker, tracking event, location and friends in attendance. 
      li Create a time program so that Rubik's cube time can be added more directly. 
      li Add a login feature so that my friends can come and view the entries.
